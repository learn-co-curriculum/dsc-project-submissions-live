# Project Submission & Review Instructions (Live)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we review the submission, review, and grading process for the Phase Projects in the Live program.

## Submission and Review Process

There are four overall steps to the project submission and review process:

1. Push work to GitHub
2. Submit deliverables on Canvas
3. Project presentations
4. Revise and resubmit (if needed)

The deadlines for each of these steps will be communicated to you by your instructor.

Your grade will not be finalized until you have completed all of these steps.

### Pushing Work to GitHub

The first step in creating your project should be to create a new GitHub repository. This can be a repository for you individually, or a repository for your group, depending on your collaboration strategy. If the project is individual, you need to create your own repository.

As you work on the project, you should be pushing changes to GitHub along the way. This helps instructors to keep an eye on your progress, and provides a backup in case anything goes wrong with the copy on your computer.

When you are ready to submit your deliverables, first make sure that you have pushed the latest version of your project to GitHub. You should be able to view the repository in the browser and double-check that your changes are there.

### Submitting Deliverables on Canvas

There are two separate assignments on Canvas for you to turn in your project. One is where you turn in PDF copies of your deliverables, and the other is where you turn in a link to your GitHub repository.

* [Phase 1 Project - PDFs]()
* [Phase 1 Project - GitHub Repository URL]()

Additional instructions are provided on the individual assignments.

When you are ready for the project presentation, first make sure that you have submitted these deliverables on Canvas.

### Presenting Projects

For group projects, collaborate with your group members to determine which of the presentation slides will be presented by each person. You will need to be prepared to present your work in front of the class, and answer questions as needed.

For individual projects, you will present to the class, to a small group, or in a 1:1 meeting depending on your instructor's preference. Be prepared to walk through your notebook code as well as your presentation slides.

For all projects, your instructor may provide immediate feedback about aspects of your project that need to be changed before a final submission. This might be something as minor as a typo, or it might be something more substantial. When presenting your project, be prepared to take notes about what changes need to be made, so you can check back and make sure that everything is fixed.

### Revising and Resubmitting (If Needed)

Revision and resubmission may or may not be part of your process. The goal of this step is to make improvements from a level 2 (Approaching Objective) to level 3 (Meets Objective), or from a level 3 to a level 4 (Exceeds Objective). The passing bar is for all objectives to be at level 3 or higher.

If your instructor requests that you make changes based on what you present, make sure that you push those new changes to GitHub as well as resubmitting the PDFs on Canvas. You should not need to resubmit the GitHub URL unless you accidentally submitted the wrong link the first time.

## Grading

All projects will be reviewed, but the process for determining whether you have passed the Phase depends on whether you passed the code challenge.

### Passed Code Challenge: Check for Completion

If you passed the code challenge, you have already passed the Phase. The project is still important for building up your portfolio and practicing the skills you have learned, but you are not required to pass the project in order to pass the Phase. You just need to make sure that you submit all of the required deliverables.

Grading these projects will be prioritized lower than grading the projects submitted by students who did not pass the code challenge. You can expect feedback before you start the next project, but potentially no sooner.

### Did Not Pass Code Challenge: Rubric Grading

If you did not pass the code challenge, your teacher will use the rubric at the bottom of the project assignment to determine whether you pass the Phase.

You must achieve a "Meets Objective" or "Exceeds Objective" for all four rubric objectives. In Phase 1, these objectives are:

* Attention to Detail
* Data Communication
* Authoring Jupyter Notebooks
* Data Manipulation and Analysis with `pandas`

See the [Phase 1 Project Description]() for complete details about these objectives.

## Conclusion

Thank you for your hard work on this project - you're going to do great! Remember that future employers will also look at your projects when deciding whether to hire you, so having complete, polished projects will help you tremendously not only to pass this assignment, but also to get the job you want after you graduate.

If you have any questions about the project submission or review process, don't hesitate to ask your teacher.
